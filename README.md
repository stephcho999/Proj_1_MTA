# 1.Effects of COVID-19 on MTA & CitiBike






# 2.How CitiBike can respond to COVID-19's effects

We wanted to see how the top MTA stations in 2019 were affected by COVID-19.
First, we looked at the top 50 MTA stations in 2019 according to sum of their daily entries.

Then, we calculated the percentage difference between 2019 and 2020 for those top 50 MTA stations.

# Conclusion

Public transportation has been disrupted. Who knows if people will resume riding the MTA? 

What citibike <em>can</em> do, is try to capture the market that MTA lost by focusing on bike stations that are close in proximity to these affected stations.

Citibike can do promotions on these bike stations by offering discounted prices for first time riders.

In addition to that, CitiBike can reassure that these bikes are sanitized by a mobile cleaning crew.
