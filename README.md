# 1.Effects of COVID-19 on MTA & CitiBike






# 2.How CitiBike can respond to COVID-19's effects

We wanted to see how the top MTA stations in 2019 were affected by COVID-19.
First, we looked at the top 50 MTA stations in 2019 according to sum of their daily entries.

Then, we calculated the percentage difference between 2019 and 2020 for those top 50 MTA stations.
